# Digital-Rain
UPDATE - Shortened and cleaned up code and added user options to change color of streams and speed. New files in update folder

A Digital Rain background I developed with Vanilla javascript for a personal site I am working on. 
It was Inspired and looks identical to the digital rain seen in the movie "The Matrix".
You can view the sample of it from a screen recording labeled "product sample.mp4" under files
