# Digital-Rain
UPDATE - Shortened and cleaned up code, added random disappearing stream chances and added user options to change color of streams and speed. New files in update folder. Live example can be found under project sections of personal site.

A Digital Rain background I developed with Vanilla javascript for a personal site I am working on. 
It was Inspired and looks identical to the digital rain seen in the movie "The Matrix".
You can view the sample of it from a screen recording labeled "product sample.mp4" under files
